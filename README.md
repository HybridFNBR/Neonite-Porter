Neonite Porter is a tool that switches your Fortnite game to Neonite Backend.

This tool was made for the people that have fiddler broken or give problems to use (my case), and well its kinda easier in this way.

How to use:

1. Run the exe called NeonitePorter, a screen pop-up will appear, click yes (fiddler certificate root stuff)
2. Open fortnite with the exe open
3. The url is set by default for locker, lobby ect, if you want a custom shop, change the url to /fortnite/api/storefront and for eventflags or anything timeline related switch to /fortnite/api/calendar/v1/timeline


This shouldnt be bannable since it redirects profile stuff to the backend, doesnt go to epic, but as always do it at your own risk

If you have any problem, dm me in discord (spush.)
